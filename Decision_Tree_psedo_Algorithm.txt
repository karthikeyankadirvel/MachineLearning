Functions
1. Create a function to calculate the class probability (labels) 
2. create a function Calculate Gini index based of the class probability function
3. Create a function (data, labels) to get the Gini index of variable based on the labels
4. Create a function (data, Gini_index_variable,label) to get split the dataset into subsets based on the attributes in the split variable

Steps:
1. Calculate the Gini index of variables
2. Split dataset based on the Gini index
3. Repeat step 1 and 2 untill the no variable left.
4. Predict function need to develop on top of it
